= v. 1.09=
    _8/October/2009_
    
    ==Code Changes:==
        * In a major piece of retooling, jobs from independent tasks which do not
          depend on each other will be run in parallel.
		  This involves major changes to the scheduling code. Please contact me asap
		  if anything breaks.

= v. 1.08=
    _12/August/2009_
    
    ==Documentation:==
        * Errors fixed. Thanks to Matteo Bertini!

    ==Code Changes:==
        * Added functions which print out job parameters more prettily.
        * `task.shorten_filenames_encoder`
        * `task.ignore_unknown_encoder`
        * Parameters which look like file paths will only have the file part printed
          (i.e. `"/a/b/c" -> 'c'`)
        * Test scripts `simpler_with_shared_logging.py` and `test_follows_mkdir.py`
          have been changed to test for this.


= v. 1.07=
    _17/June/2009_
    
    ==Code Changes:==
        * Added `proxy_logger` module for accessing a shared log across multiple jobs in
          different processes.

= v. 1.06=
    _12/June/2009_
    
    ==Bug fix:==
        * _Ruffus_ version module (`ruffus_version.py`) links fixed
          Soft links in linux do not travel well
        * `mkdir` now can take a list of strings
          added test case

    ==Documentation:==
        * Added history of changes

= v. 1.05=
    _11/June/2009_

    ==Bug fix:==
        * Changed "graph_printout" to `pipeline_printout_graph` in documentation.
          This function had been renamed in the code but not in the documentation :-(

    ==Documentation:==
        * Added example for sharing synchronising data between jobs.
          This shows how different jobs can write to a common log file while still leaveraging the full power of _ruffus_.
        

    ==Code Changes:==
        * The graph and print_dependencies modules are no longer exported by default from task.
          Please email me if this breaks anything.
        * More informative error message when refer to unadorned (without _Ruffus_ decorators) python functions as pipelined Tasks
        * Added Ruffus version module `ruffus_version.py`



= v. 1.04=
    _05/June/2009_
    ==Bug fix: ==

        * `task.task_names_to_tasks` did not include tasks specified by function rather than name
        * `task.run_all_jobs_in_task` did not work properly without multiprocessing (# of jobs = 1)
        * `task.pipeline_run` only uses multiprocessing pools if `multiprocess` (# of jobs)  > 1
    
    ==Changes to allow python 2.4/2.5 to run:==

        * `setup.py` changed to remove dependency
        * `simplejson` can be loaded instead of python 2.6 `json` module
        * Changed `NamedTemporaryFile` to `mkstemp` because delete parameter is not avaliable before python 2.6

    ==Windows programmes==

        It is necessary to protect the "entry point" of the program under windows.
        Otherwise, a new process with be created recursively, like the magicians's apprentice
        See: http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming
