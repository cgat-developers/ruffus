    _11/June/2009_

    ==Bug fix:==
        * Changed "graph_printout" to "pipeline_printout_graph" in documentation.
          This function had been renamed in the code but not in the documentation :-(

    ==Documentation:==
        * Added example for sharing synchronising data between jobs.
          This shows how different jobs can write to a common log file while still leaveraging the full power of _ruffus_.
        

    ==Code Changes:==
        * The graph and print_dependencies modules are no longer exported by default from task.
          Please email me if this breaks anything.
        * More informative error message when refer to unadorned (without _Ruffus_ decorators) python functions as pipelined Tasks



= v. 1.04=
    _05/June/2009_
    ==Bug fix: ==

        task.task_names_to_tasks did not include tasks specified by function rather than name
        
        task.run_all_jobs_in_task, did not work properly without multiprocessing (# of jobs = 1)

        task.pipeline_run only uses multiprocessing pools if multiprocess (# of jobs)  > 1
    
    ==Changes to allow python 2.4/2.5 to run:==

        setup.py changed to remove dependency

        simplejson can be loaded instead of python 2.6 json module

        Changed !NamedTemporaryFile to mkstemp because delete parameter is not avaliable before python 2.6

    ==Windows programmes==

        It is necessary to protect the "entry point" of the program under windows.
        Otherwise, a new process with be created recursively, like the magicians's apprentice
        See: http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming
